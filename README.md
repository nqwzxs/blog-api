# Blog API

This is the backend API for the blogging platform, built as part of [The Odin Project's Node.js curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-nodejs-blog-api) with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It handles blog post CRUD operations, comment management, user authentication, and serves as the central data layer for both the client and CMS apps.
